# Code Quiz

- In this project, I created a timed, multiple choice quiz
that asks some basic coding questions.

## Overview

- The quiz is styled using Bootstrap containers, buttons, and an input form.
- You have 60 seconds to answer 6 questions. When you finish, or run out of time,
a page pops up where you can enter your name to save your score.
- Once you submit your score, you are taken to a list of scores from your
localStorage and there is a button to retake the quiz.
- When you get an answer wrong, you are alerted and 10 seconds are removed from
your time remaining.
